# Weather-Application-using-Angular


In this project, I connect my angular application to a public API.

I used Angular forms to get user inputs where the user will type in the city name in this Angular weather applicaTION and then based on the city name, it'll fetch the weather data for the city from the weather API.

API, I've used in this project is Open weather API.
